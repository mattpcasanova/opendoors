        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <p>
            Welcome to OpenDoors! By using our mobile application, you agree to these Terms of Service.
            Please read them carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By creating an account and using OpenDoors, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service
            and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use OpenDoors. By creating an account, you represent
            that you meet this age requirement.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Account Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the security of your account credentials</li>
            <li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
            <li>Providing accurate and up-to-date information</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized account access</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How OpenDoors Works</h2>

        <h3>Earning Doors (Game Plays)</h3>
        <p>You can earn doors by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching advertisements (limit: 3 per day)</li>
            <li>Referring friends who complete their first game</li>
            <li>Receiving them from partner businesses</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Playing Games</h3>
        <p>
            Each door allows you to play one game. Game results are determined by probability and chance.
            No purchase is necessary to play.
        </p>

        <h3>Winning and Redeeming Prizes</h3>
        <p>
            When you win a prize, you have 30 days to redeem it at the partner business. After 30 days,
            unclaimed prizes expire. Prizes have no cash value and cannot be transferred or sold.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create multiple accounts to circumvent daily limits</li>
            <li>Use bots, scripts, or automation to interact with the app</li>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate game outcomes or exploit bugs</li>
            <li>Share or sell your account</li>
            <li>Engage in fraudulent prize redemptions</li>
            <li>Harass or abuse other users or businesses</li>
            <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Prize Disclaimers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prizes are provided by independent partner businesses, not OpenDoors</li>
            <li>OpenDoors is not responsible for the quality or availability of prizes</li>
            <li>Businesses may modify or discontinue prizes at any time</li>
            <li>Some prizes may have additional terms or restrictions</li>
            <li>Prizes expire 30 days after being won</li>
            <li>Prizes cannot be redeemed for cash</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            OpenDoors displays advertisements from Google AdMob. We are not responsible for the content
            of third-party advertisements. You interact with ads at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time for violating these
            Terms of Service, engaging in fraudulent activity, or for any other reason at our discretion.
            You may delete your account at any time from the app settings.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>

            We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Significant changes will be announced
            in the app. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>
