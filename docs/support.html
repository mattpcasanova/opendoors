        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I earn doors (game plays)?</h3>
            <p>You can earn doors by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Watching up to 3 video ads per day (resets at midnight EST)</li>
                <li>Referring friends - both you and your friend get +1 door when they play their first game</li>
                <li>Receiving them from partner businesses as rewards</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I play a game?</h3>
            <p>
                Select a game on the home screen and use one door to play. In the Monty Hall game, pick a
                door, then decide whether to stay with your choice or switch to another door. The prize
                behind your final choice is what you win!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I redeem a prize?</h3>
            <p>
                After winning, go to your Rewards screen and tap on the prize. Show the QR code to staff
                at the partner business to redeem. Prizes expire 30 days after being won.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Why can't I watch more ads?</h3>
            <p>
                You can watch a maximum of 3 ads per day. The limit resets at midnight Eastern Time.
                This ensures fair play and prevents abuse.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do referrals work?</h3>
            <p>
                Share your unique referral code from your profile. When a friend signs up using your code
                and plays their first game, you both receive +1 door as a bonus!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I transfer or sell prizes?</h3>
            <p>
                No, prizes are non-transferable and have no cash value. They can only be redeemed by the
                account holder who won them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What if a business won't accept my prize?</h3>
            <p>
                Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@opendoorsgame.com">support@opendoorsgame.com</a>
                with details about the business and prize. We'll work with the partner to resolve the issue.

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
            <p>
                Go to Profile → Settings → Delete Account. This will permanently delete all your data,
                including unclaimed prizes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Is OpenDoors free to play?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! OpenDoors is completely free. You never need to pay to earn doors or play games.
                We generate revenue through advertising.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>What are the odds of winning each prize?</h3>
            <p>
                Each prize tier has different odds based on its value. Higher-value prizes are rarer.
                The Monty Hall game follows classic probability - switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance
                of winning, while staying gives you a 1/3 chance.
            </p>
